**Expenditure_Analyzer**
***Why*** this app?
This **crossplatform (react native)** app is solution of one of the big problem in our society : **Non-standardized**, **Non-transparent** service sector pricing i.e. **Medical bills are biggest cause of personal bankruptcies**. We solve this problem by: **Decentralized** database of medical costs, **Cryptocurrency** to incentivize reporting medical bills resulting in consumer empowerment in healthcare pricing We **extend** this idea to not only healthcare but more sectors of **non-standardized**, **non-transparent** services.

***
Our Appp utilizes **computer vision**, **distributed ledger** and a **public cryptocurrency** to solve this problem of inconsistent and inequitable pricing of medical procedures.

***
Walkover through our App

* Patient-consumer requests line-item bill from any service sector.
* Patient-consumer uploads a photo of the bill using our mobile app
* Our App tells the patient-customer the fair/common price of each item and rewards them in the form of **public cryptocurrency Coins.**
* Consumers are incentivized to upload their line-item medical bills via two channels: 1) By uploading their bills, our software will tell you what the fair/common price of each item is. 2) Patients are rewarded with a certain amount of our cryptocurrency (My BitCoing MBC) in return. This publicly-traded cryptocurrency will assume value and reward our users accordingly.

When consumer recieves these bill, he have no choice but to accept it and thats where our app comes in.
